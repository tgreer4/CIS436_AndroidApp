# CIS436_AndroidApp
This is for the UM-Dearborn class, CIS 436 Mobile App Design, taken in Winter 2022. There are two projects: Two Dice Game and a Calculator

Two Dice game

The rules for the 2 player game are as follows:
  If the player rolls a single 1, they score nothing, and it becomes the next player’s turn
  If the player rolls both 1s, their total score is lost, and their turn ends
  If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total, and the player’s turn continues
  If a player chooses to hold, their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player’s turn
  If a double (both same face value, but not 1s) is rolled, the point total is added to their turn total like normal, 
    BUT the player is obligated to roll again. This means that they cannot choose to HOLD for the next roll (the HOLD option is disabled)
    
 Everything works as instructed. The app follows the above rules and works correctly.

Calculator
Basic calculator with operators of adding, subtracting, dividing, multiplying, and modulo. Basic adding, subtracting, and multiplying works.
The negate button only works if not using most recent result. Operation buttons do not work from the previous result. Layout issues with keypad.
